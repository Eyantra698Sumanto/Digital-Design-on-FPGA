# Interfacing Seven segment
A seven-segment display (SSD) is a form of electronic display device for displaying decimal numbers. They can be used as an alternative to complex display's such as dot matrix.

A SSD has 7 segments and theoretically we can use it to display 2^7 = 128 combinations of characters. But most of these combinations, doesn't make sense to a human eye. Decimal numbers can be displayed correctly on a 7 segment panel.

Truth table for the BCD to seven segment display:</br>
